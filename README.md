# WonderNAV

One of the greatest pain-points I encountered while studying abroad was trip-planning. It was hard to find resources online that were not heavily advertised and touristy. On top of that, making a rough schedule of everywhere I go ended up being very time-consuming. In this project, I want to provide a working solution to the problem through the use of LLMs. WonderNav is an backend infrastructure for a smart traveling assistant that elevates its user's trip-planning experience through flexibility and accuracy.
